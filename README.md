# Cell Phone Store

## What is it about?

The project consists of a cell phone store where you will find different sections of the project.

The project was created with HTML and CSS. These two technologies allow me to layout and style my page.

## How is your HTML constructed?

HTML has three main parts: the Header, Main, and Footer:

* Within the header, there are two sections and a nav. One of the sections contains the logo, while the other contains the forms. The nav contains my entire navigation bar.

* main. The main contains several sections where the catalog, information, and other information are located.

* The footer is divided into three sections, the first containing the logo and other important information for the page.
